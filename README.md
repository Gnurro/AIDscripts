# AIDscripts
## Scripts for AI Dungeon (play.aidungeon.io)

All JS scenario script zips should import as-is on AID.
Python scripts require Python 3.


## JS scenario scripts:

Encounters: Dynamic game event framework, with plenty functionality. See Encounters folder for more info.

RPGmech: No giant robots, but RPG mechanics in AID, using InputDCattributeBot and the skill/stat menus. Has example of piping placeholders into skills as well. Now with plenty more docstrings.

PlaceholderGrab: Grab encapsulated placeholders for scripting.

RandomNamesReplacer: Replaces a list of names with completely randomly generated words (with some rudimentary morphology).

TemmieSpeak: Turns normal player inputs into tEMmiE speK, bUt Yo Cn gO COlEg t fiX i.

EditorsNote: (HACKY!) Changes 'Author's Note:' to 'Editor's Note:', in a bruteforce way.
