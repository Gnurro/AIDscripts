# AIDscripts
JS scripts for AI Dungeon (play.aidungeon.io)

All zips should import as-is on AID.



RPGmech: No giant robots, but RPG mechanics in AID, using InputDCattributeBot and the skill/stat menus. Has example of piping placeholders into skills as well. Now with plenty more docstrings.

PlaceholderGrab: Grab encapsulated placeholders for scripting.

RandomNamesReplacer: Replaces a list of names with completely randomly generated words (with some rudimentary morphology).

EditorsNote: (HACKY!) Changes 'Author's Note:' to 'Editor's Note:', in a bruteforce way.

FixQuotes: Fixes missing/trailing quotes.

FormChangeMaintain: Commands to set a context note that tells Ai which form you are in. Lotsa QoL.

UwUfier: Don't ask.
