## Scripts for AI Dungeon (play.aidungeon.io)

Python scripts require Python 3.


## JS scenario scripts:

Encounters: Dynamic game event framework, with plenty functionality. See Encounters folder for more info.

PlaceholderGrab: Grab encapsulated placeholders for scripting.

RandomNamesReplacer: Replaces a list of names with completely randomly generated words (with some rudimentary morphology).

TemmieSpeak: Turns normal player inputs into tEMmiE speK, bUt Yo Cn gO COlEg t fiX i.

EditorsNote: (HACKY!) Changes 'Author's Note:' to 'Editor's Note:', in a bruteforce way.
